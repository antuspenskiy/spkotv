Like JQuery, you may use HTRAF under the terms of either the MIT License
or the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2

The MIT License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy
to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do
with HTRAF.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use HTRAF
under that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other
and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are
free to use HTRAF in commercial projects as long as the copyright header
is left intact.
